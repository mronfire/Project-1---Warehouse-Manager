# Project-1---T.E.A.M
This is CS1C first project 

                                                   BULK CLUB CLASS PROJECT

Your team to write a program that services members of Bulk Club.

You must use inheritance, composition and at least two overloaded operators.  At least one class must contain a pointer (a copy constructor needs to be written and tested).   Highlight the above in your code.

Write at least 10 agile stories (including description, tasks, test scenarios, and story points) before software is developed.  Teams should use QT, DOXYGEN, and GIT.  Only team members should have access to their repository. 

Run Doxygen on your source code.

The Scrum master should log all team meetings.

The team must follow the Scrum process (the Scrum master must document all meetings and the product owner must document the backlog).

Sprint schedule:
First sprint: September 15th – July 29th
Second sprint: September 29th – October 13th

Bulk Club has two types of members: Regular and Executive 
Member information includes:
-	Member name
-	Membership number
-	Membership type
-	Membership expiration date
-	Total amount spent (running total)
-	Rebate amount (Executive members only)

A rebate of 3.25% of the total amount spent (not to include sales tax) is paid at the close of the year to the Executive members. Regular members pay annual dues of $85.00 and Executive members pay annual dues of $95.00. Your program will use the following files that will be provided:

-	A membership information file that will contain the member name, member number, membership type, and expiration date
-	Five sales files that contain details of member shopping for a day (member number, items purchased and prices - items not to exceed 100 on any given trip)

Your program should read from the daily sales file and update the members’ information accordingly. As the sales are processed the total amount spent and rebate data for each member should be updated. Assume a sales tax rate of 7 1/4%.

Generate the following reports/request at any time:

1.	A sales report for any given day. It should include a list of items and quantities sold on that day as well names of the members who shopped that day.  Report the total revenue for the given day.  It should also include number of Executive members and Regular members who shopped during the given day.  Provide an option to generate the report by membership type.
2.	A report that prints the total purchases for all members sorted by membership number.  It should also include a grand total of the purchases. 
3.	A report that prints out the quantity of each item sold sorted by item name and the total revenue for each item.
4.	A report that prints out the rebate of all the Executive members sorted by membership number.
5.	A user of your program should be able to enter a month and get a list of all members whose memberships expire that month as well as the cost to renew their memberships.
6.	A user should be able to add/delete members. 
a.	Create purchases for the new members to validate your software.
7.	A user should be able to add (with a corresponding price)/delete items.    
8.	A user of your program should be able to enter an item name and get the quantity of that item sold as well as the total revenue for the item.
9.	A user of your program should be able to enter a membership number or name and get a list of the items and total purchases per that member.
10.	Your program should be able to determine if any Regular customer should convert their membership to Executive status.
11.	Determine if any Executive customer should convert their membership to Regular status.
12.	Save all changes between executions.

Design a very readable, easy to use interface to demonstrate your program.  Contingency handling should include addressing invalid input such as invalid membership number, invalid member type, invalid item name, etc.  All projects are due by July 20th.   No late projects will be accepted. Your team must demonstrate your project to me before it will be graded.   Each teammate must identify their accomplishments on the project.
